            <h3>3.2 International Customs & Duties</h3>
            <p>
                International orders are subject to customs duties, taxes, and import fees, which are the responsibility of the recipient. These charges are determined by the destination country and are not included in the shipping cost. Please check your country's customs regulations before ordering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Customs clearance can add 3-7 business days to delivery time. We provide all necessary documentation to expedite customs processing, but delays are sometimes unavoidable.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Restricted Shipping Destinations</h3>
            <p>
                We currently do not ship to the following countries due to customs restrictions or shipping limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Iran, Syria, North Korea, and other OFAC-restricted countries</li>
                <li>Certain remote islands and territories</li>

            <h2>4. Tracking & Delivery Confirmation</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Tracking Information</h3>
            <p>
                Once your order ships, you will receive an email with:

            <h3>4.2 Delivery Confirmation</h3>
            <p>
                Most shipments require a signature upon delivery. Some packages may be left at your doorstep without signature if you authorized it or the carrier determines it's safe.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Signature Options</h3>
            <p>
                For orders shipped via UPS or FedEx, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authorize package delivery without signature through the carrier's website</li>
                <li>Request hold for pickup at a local facility</li>
                <li>Leave delivery instructions for the carrier</li>

            <h3>9.1 Holiday Processing</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Islamic Holidays:</strong> During Ramadan and Eid celebrations (Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha), there is a possibility of processing and shipping delays as we observe these sacred occasions. We will do our best to maintain regular operations, but we recommend ordering in advance if your delivery date falls near these holidays.

            <h3>9.3 Weather & Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>
